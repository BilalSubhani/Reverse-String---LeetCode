344. Reverse String
<br>Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory. 

Example 1:<br>
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]<br>
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:<br>
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]<br>
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:<br>
1 <= s.length <= 105<br>
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
